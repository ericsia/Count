Background overview: 
given a game named NNN task is to kill zombie with other gamers, the time they online is random except during 5pm to 7pm. 
In each pk with zombie the time to kill a group of zombies is relative constant depend on other player ammo power (example 1 round is around 0.6second). 
You are given 500 times a day to kill as many round of zombie as u like at whichever time convienient for u and u will receive gold coins but from 5pm to 7pm is bonus round which gives u more gold coins. 
500 times is exceeded the number of pk times during 5pm to 7pm which at most ur team can roughly kill 223 times only. 
So your target is finished 277times when ur team come online and left 223 for 5pm to 7pm, u hate to wait infront of screen so u only want to check once 227times is used up. 
Also Saturday got activity to earn more Coins start from 5pm and finish roughly around 1 hours, so u can have to finish >277 times on Saturday. 

Task, use ur coding skill to write an app to calculate the time when 227 is used up
